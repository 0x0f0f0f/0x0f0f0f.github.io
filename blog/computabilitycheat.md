I made these two posters containing computability theory and complexity theory basic knowledge, theorems and short intuitive proofs.
Although this is meant for an undergraduate computer science course, I hope these will result useful for anybody interested in the subject. 

You can find the source code in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/computability-complexity-cheat-sheets).
Please open an issue if you find any mistake or typo!
