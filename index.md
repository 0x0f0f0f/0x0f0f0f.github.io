My interests lie around functional programming, abstract algebra, computability
theory, foundations of programming languages and logic in formal systems. For
me, a constant source of ispiration is *Gödel, Escher Bach* by Douglas
Hofstadter: I am fascinated by the interdisciplinary intersections between
computation, cognitive neuroscience, biology, medicine, category theory,
genomics, artificial intelligence and the foundations of logics and
computability. I make my way fast through any UNIX terminal and often play around
with electronics and Raspberry Pis, building things out of Linux SBCs. I’m an
avid reader, digital archiver and a strong supporter of the Julia programming
language. When I’m not at at a terminal, I love making electronic music and
playing the guitar.

that particular sorting algorithm, but I am quite efficient at finding and
searching through information and books. Find my code at github.com/0x0f0f0f.
